Open html file

I left the minified version. Simply running the index.html will show the widget.
The data is hardcoded since I dont have a api key. But implementing the api is really easy, I expect that is not the idea of the assignment.

This widget should work in any application html,react, angular,vue by importing 'weather-widget' and using it with its props.

Normally this would be published into a npm package to install on any project.
